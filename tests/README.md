Test files can be (and have been) very helpful during development to validate the implementation of many sub-task (especially data-related: dataset creation, data processing, adding noise to data, etc). 

We did not maintain a continous integration pipeline with on-going tests at each model change however, so the test files in this folder are likely outdated and one should not expect them to work.

Tests can be run easily with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/).
